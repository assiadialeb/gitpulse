- Commit messages follow **Conventional Commits**:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation
  - `test:` for adding tests
  - `refactor:` for code restructuring without changing behavior
- All Python functions and classes must have **docstrings**.

## üîÑ Testing and CI/CD

- All contributions must pass the test suite.
- We use GitHub Actions to run automated tests on every PR.
- PRs with failing tests will not be merged.
- We aim for **high code coverage**; new features should come with tests.
