# üß≠ What is GitPulse?

**GitPulse** is an open-source dashboard designed to analyze developer activity and contribution trends within a GitHub organization.

I started building it as a **CTO** because I couldn't find a tool that was simple and reliable enough to track the activity of my teams and products. GitPulse is a **personal project**, developed during my free time. It will evolve based on my availability and interests.
Most GitHub/Git analytics tools focus on repository-level data. GitPulse lets you group multiple repositories into a single logical project ‚Äî reflecting how real software is built and delivered. Perfect for tracking large apps, microservices, or monorepo-like architectures.

I'm currently building GitPulse **solo**, with no QA team. If you encounter bugs or unexpected behavior, **contributions are welcome**‚Äîas long as they stay aligned with the spirit of the project: useful, readable, and not overengineered.

## ‚ú® Key Features

üß© Project-Level Aggregation: Group multiple repositories into a single product or initiative to track contributions, trends, and metrics across an entire software unit ‚Äî not just per repo.

üìä Comprehensive Analytics: Track commits, pull requests, reviews, merges, and contributor activity.

üë• Developer Insights: Understand individual and team-level behaviors over time.

üìà Trend Analysis: Spot slowdowns, bottlenecks, or productivity shifts through contribution trends.

üîç Repository Analytics: Dive into activity metrics and code quality signals per repository.

‚ö° Live GitHub Sync: Realtime updates powered by the GitHub API, no manual refresh.

üéØ Integrations: Many integrations OSS Index, Github, CycloneDX and more to come (sonarqube, Snyk...)

## üéØ Who is it for?

- **CTOs** who want a clear view of team productivity and project health
- **Tech Leads** aiming to optimize engineering workflows
- **Project Managers / POs** tracking delivery progress and team dynamics
- **Developers** curious about their own or their team's contribution patterns
- **Open Source Maintainers** monitoring community activity

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture (briefly)

GitPulse uses a modern but focused tech stack:

- **Backend**: Django 5.2+ (Python 3.12)
- **Databases**: MongoDB (analytics data) + PostgreSQL (user data)
- **Task Queue**: Django-Q
- **UI**: Responsive frontend with DaisyUI
- **Deployment**: Docker-ready with clean documentation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker 
‚ö†Ô∏è GitPulse is still in early development. The code and Docker setup are subject to change.
If you‚Äôre looking for a stable deployment method, please wait for the first official release.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/assiadialeb/gitpulse.git
cd GitPulse
cp env.example .env
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Option 2: Local Installation

#### Requirements
- Python >= 3.12
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Ollama
- NPM


```bash
git clone https://github.com/assiadialeb/gitpulse.git
cd GitPulse
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
cp env.example .env
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: Don‚Äôt forget to review and adapt the .env file to match your local environment (e.g., database settings, GitHub token, debug mode, etc.).
