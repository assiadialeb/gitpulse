- **Project Health**: Understand project progress and bottlenecks
- **Team Performance**: Identify productivity trends and areas for improvement

## üèóÔ∏è Core Features

### üìä Analytics Dashboard

- **Commit Analytics**: Track commit frequency, size, and patterns
- **Pull Request Metrics**: Monitor PR creation, review times, and merge rates
- **Developer Insights**: Individual and team performance metrics
- **Repository Health**: Overall project status and trends

### üë• Developer Management

- **Developer Profiles**: Individual contributor analytics
- **Team Grouping**: Organize developers into teams
- **Activity Tracking**: Monitor daily, weekly, and monthly activity
- **Contribution Analysis**: Understand contribution patterns

### üîç Repository Analysis

This screen provides a high-level overview of repository activity, developer contributions, and key health indicators. It aggregates commit frequency, pull request metrics, licensing compliance, and vulnerability scans to give tech leads and managers a quick snapshot of project vitality and team productivity.
It includes commit/change statistics, PR cycle time, release cadence, and deployment frequency‚Äîoffering both raw numbers and computed scores for immediate insight.

- **Code Quality Metrics**: ‚ÄúTrack code quality indicators‚Äù

(coming soon)

- **Commit Frequency**: ‚ÄúQuantifying coding rhythm and consistency‚Äù

This panel evaluates how frequently and consistently code is pushed to the repository, providing a set of scores to assess recent development momentum:

- Recent Activity Score: Reflects the proportion of commits made in the last 30 days relative to the last 90 days. A score of 100 indicates high recent engagement.
- Consistency Score: Measures how regularly commits occur over time, highlighting the steadiness of contributions.
- Overall Frequency Score: A weighted score that combines average commit frequency, recency, and consistency into a single global indicator of activity health.
- Commits Last 30 Days: Raw count of commits over the last month.
- Active Days: Total days with at least one commit activity‚Äîused to assess daily engagement.

A tooltip expands to explain the formulas used for each score, making the metrics transparent and easy to interpret.

- **Commit Classification**: ‚ÄúAI-powered commit categorization‚Äù

This view breaks down the types of commits in the codebase‚Äîfeatures, fixes, refactors, chores, etc.‚Äîgiving a clear picture of development focus.
It also provides key derived ratios:

- Feature-to-Fix Ratio shows a high focus on new features over bug fixing‚Äîsuggesting code stability.
- Test Coverage Ratio indicates a lack of test-related commits, which could affect confidence in software quality.
- Focus Ratio evaluates the balance between product-driven work and infrastructure/documentation efforts, showing a healthy distribution.

This section helps assess team priorities and code maturity at a glance.

- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns over time

This bubble chart maps commit activity over the last 30 days, plotted by hour of day.
Each bubble‚Äôs size represents the number of commits at a given time and date.

This visualization helps identify:

- Typical working hours or unusual activity times
- Periods of intense development or inactivity
- Patterns across different days and times

It‚Äôs useful for understanding team habits and optimizing collaboration or review windows.

- **Release Frequency**: ‚ÄúShipping velocity and code review responsiveness‚Äù

This section helps assess how often code is being shipped and how efficiently pull requests are processed.

It shows:

- Average releases per month and week
- PR Cycle Time (median and average): the time between opening and merging PRs
- Total number of PRs analyzed during the selected period

These metrics reveal how quickly changes reach production, highlighting the team‚Äôs delivery velocity and responsiveness.

- **Compliance**: ‚ÄúLicense compliance, dependency vulnerabilities, and code quality‚Äù

This view provides a summary of the licensing status of all detected components within the project. It includes:

- AI-Powered Legal Summary: Automatically generated insights on whether licenses permit commercial use and pose compliance risks.
- Key Obligations & Recommendations: Clearly outlines licensing duties (e.g., attribution, patent clauses) and best practices to follow.
- License Compatibility Table: Shows each package, its license (MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.), and whether it‚Äôs safe for commercial use.
- Legal Disclaimer: States that this analysis is informational and does not replace legal review.

The ‚ÄúCaution‚Äù warning signals that while no blocking licenses were found, a careful review is still recommended for full compliance assurance.
