# Project Analytics Overview

GitPulse allows you to group multiple repositories into logical projects, providing portfolio-level insights across your entire product ecosystem.

## What are Projects?

Projects in GitPulse represent logical groupings of related repositories. They help you:

- **Track Cross-Repository Metrics**: Combined insights across multiple codebases
- **Monitor Team Performance**: Developer activity across related services
- **Assess Portfolio Health**: Security and quality trends at the project level
- **Plan Resource Allocation**: Understand development effort distribution

## Project Management

### Creating Projects

1. **Navigate to Projects**: Go to the Projects section in GitPulse
2. **Create New Project**: Click "Create Project"
3. **Define Scope**: Select repositories that belong to the project
4. **Enjoy**

### Project Types

#### Microservices Architecture
Group repositories by service boundaries:

- **User Service**: Authentication and user management
- **Payment Service**: Payment processing and billing
- **Notification Service**: Email and messaging
- **API Gateway**: Request routing and aggregation

#### Product Lines
Organize by product or feature areas:

- **Core Platform**: Essential infrastructure and services
- **Mobile Apps**: iOS and Android applications
- **Web Applications**: Frontend and backend web services
- **Admin Tools**: Internal management and monitoring

#### Team Ownership
Group by team responsibility:

- **Frontend Team**: UI/UX and client-side development
- **Backend Team**: API and server-side development
- **DevOps Team**: Infrastructure and deployment
- **Data Team**: Analytics and data processing

## Project Analytics

### Cross-Repository Metrics

Projects provide aggregated metrics across all included repositories:

#### Security Health Score (SHS)

- **Weighted Average**: SHS scores weighted by repository size
- **Portfolio Risk**: Overall security posture assessment
- **Trend Analysis**: Security improvement across the project
- **Vulnerability Distribution**: Critical issues across repositories

#### Code Quality Overview

- **Quality Distribution**: SonarCloud ratings across repositories
- **Technical Debt**: Combined technical debt assessment
- **Coverage Metrics**: Overall test coverage statistics
- **Maintainability**: Average maintainability scores

#### Development Activity

- **Total Commits**: Combined commit activity across repositories
- **Developer Distribution**: Team member activity across services
- **Activity Patterns**: Peak development times and trends
- **Collaboration Metrics**: Cross-repository collaboration

### Team Performance Analysis

#### Developer Insights

- **Cross-Repository Activity**: Developer contributions across services
- **Expertise Areas**: Which repositories each developer works on
- **Collaboration Patterns**: Team member interactions
- **Knowledge Distribution**: Skill spread across the project

#### Team Dynamics

- **Service Ownership**: Clear ownership of different repositories
- **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Inter-team communication patterns
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Documentation and code review practices
- **Skill Gaps**: Areas needing additional expertise

### Portfolio Management

#### Resource Allocation

- **Development Effort**: Time spent on different repositories
- **Priority Assessment**: Which services need attention
- **Capacity Planning**: Team capacity across services
- **Risk Management**: Identifying high-risk areas

#### Strategic Planning

- **Technology Stack**: Programming language distribution
- **Dependency Analysis**: Shared dependencies across services
- **Architecture Health**: Service interaction patterns
- **Scalability Assessment**: Growth and scaling considerations

## Using Project Analytics

### For Engineering Leadership

1. **Portfolio Overview**: Assess overall engineering health
2. **Resource Planning**: Allocate teams and resources effectively
3. **Risk Assessment**: Identify problematic areas across services
4. **Strategic Decisions**: Make informed technology choices

### For Product Management

1. **Feature Impact**: Understand how features affect multiple services
2. **Release Planning**: Coordinate releases across repositories
3. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure quality across the entire product
4. **User Experience**: Track improvements across all touchpoints

### For DevOps Teams

1. **Infrastructure Planning**: Understand deployment complexity
2. **Monitoring Strategy**: Set up monitoring across services
3. **Security Posture**: Assess security across the portfolio
4. **Performance Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks across services

## Project Configuration

### Repository Selection

Choose repositories that logically belong together:

- **Functional Relationship**: Repositories that work together
- **Team Ownership**: Repositories managed by the same team
- **Technology Stack**: Repositories using similar technologies
- **Business Domain**: Repositories serving the same business area




## Best Practices

### Project Organization

1. **Logical Grouping**: Group repositories by function, not just team
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Define what belongs in each project
3. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess project composition
4. **Documentation**: Document project purpose and scope

### Analytics Usage

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check project health weekly
2. **Trend Analysis**: Track improvements over time
3. **Action Planning**: Use insights to plan improvements
4. **Team Communication**: Share project insights with teams

### Continuous Improvement

1. **Goal Setting**: Establish project-level goals
2. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor progress toward goals
3. **Process Optimization**: Improve development processes
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Share best practices across projects

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Missing Repository Data

- **Cause**: Repositories not properly indexed
- **Solution**: Check repository indexing status and permissions
