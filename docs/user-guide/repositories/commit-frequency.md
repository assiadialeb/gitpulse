</figure>

**What it tells you:**
- Overall development volume
- Activity level compared to previous periods
- Development momentum and engagement

### Commits Details

</figure>

**What it tells you:**
- Code expansion rate
- Development velocity
- Feature development progress

### Commit Change Stats

Detailed statistics about code changes including:
- Lines added vs. lines removed
- File modification patterns
- Change distribution across the codebase

</figure>

**What it tells you:**
- Development vs. maintenance balance
- Code churn and stability
- Refactoring vs. new feature development


### Commit Frequency

The rate at which commits are made over time, measured as commits per day, week, or month depending on the selected time period.

</figure>

**What it tells you:**
- Development rhythm and consistency
- Team productivity patterns
- Project activity health

## Advanced Activity Metrics

### Recent Activity Score


<figure markdown="span">
![Commit Frequency Score](../../images/Commit_Frequency.png){ width="400" }
<figcaption>Commit Frequency Score</figcaption>
</figure>


Measures the proportion of commits made in the last 30 days relative to the last 90 days:

- **100**: High recent engagement
- **80-99**: Good recent activity
- **60-79**: Moderate recent activity
- **40-59**: Low recent activity
- **0-39**: Very low recent activity

**What it tells you:**
- Whether development is accelerating or slowing
- If the team is actively working on the project
- Recent momentum compared to historical patterns

### Consistency Score

Measures how regularly commits occur over time:

- **100**: Very consistent development rhythm
- **80-99**: Good consistency
- **60-79**: Moderate consistency
- **40-59**: Irregular patterns
- **0-39**: Very inconsistent development

**What it tells you:**
- Whether development follows a predictable schedule
- If the team has established good habits
- How well the development process is structured

### Overall Frequency Score

A weighted score combining average commit frequency, recency, and consistency:

- **100**: Excellent development health
- **80-99**: Good development health
- **60-79**: Fair development health
- **40-59**: Poor development health
- **0-39**: Critical development health

**What it tells you:**
- Overall assessment of development activity
- Whether the project is healthy and active
- If intervention is needed to improve productivity

## Activity Breakdown

### Commits Last 30 Days

Raw count of commits over the last month:

- **High (50+)**: Very active development
- **Medium (20-49)**: Normal development activity
- **Low (5-19)**: Light development activity
- **Very Low (0-4)**: Minimal development activity

### Active Days

Total days with at least one commit activity:

- **High (20+ days)**: Consistent daily development
- **Medium (10-19 days)**: Regular development
- **Low (5-9 days)**: Intermittent development
- **Very Low (0-4 days)**: Rare development activity

## Time-Based Analysis

### Commit Activity by Hour

This visualization shows when commits occur throughout the day:

<figure markdown="span">
![Commit Activity by Hour](../../images/Commit_Activity_by_Hour.png){ width="400" }
<figcaption>Daily Commit Patterns</figcaption>
</figure>

**What it reveals:**
- **Peak Hours**: When the team is most active
- **Working Patterns**: Typical development schedules
- **Global Teams**: Multiple timezone activity
- **Overtime Patterns**: After-hours development

### Weekly Patterns

Track activity across different days of the week:

- **Monday**: Start-of-week activity levels
- **Midweek**: Peak development days
- **Friday**: End-of-week patterns
- **Weekend**: Off-hours development
