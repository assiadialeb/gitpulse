# Repository Analytics Overview

GitPulse provides comprehensive analytics for individual repositories, helping you understand code quality, development patterns, and security posture.

## Repository Dashboard

The repository detail page offers a complete view of your codebase health and development activity. Each repository displays key metrics organized into intuitive sections:

## Key Metrics Sections

### Security Health Score (SHS)
Advanced security metrics using CodeQL integration to evaluate vulnerability density and severity.

- **Real-time Security Assessment**: Continuous monitoring of security posture
- **Vulnerability Analysis**: Critical, High, Medium, and Low severity tracking
- **Trend Monitoring**: Security improvement or deterioration over time
- **Size-Normalized Scoring**: Fair comparison across repositories of different sizes

### Code Quality Metrics
SonarCloud integration provides comprehensive code quality analysis:

- **Maintainability**: Code complexity and technical debt assessment
- **Reliability**: Bug density and reliability rating
- **Security**: Security hotspots and vulnerabilities
- **Coverage**: Test coverage percentage

### Development Activity
Track commit patterns and developer contributions:

- **Commit Frequency**: Development rhythm and consistency
- **Developer Activity**: Individual and team contribution patterns
- **Activity Trends**: Peak development times and patterns
- **Contribution Distribution**: Files and areas of focus

### Repository Size Analysis
KLOC (Kilo Lines of Code) tracking:

- **Current Size**: Total lines of code in the repository
- **Historical Tracking**: Size evolution over time
- **Growth Patterns**: Repository expansion trends

## Interactive Features

### Date Range Selection

## Best Practices

### Regular Monitoring
- Check repository analytics weekly for trends
- Monitor security metrics for new vulnerabilities
- Track code quality improvements over time

### Actionable Insights
- Use metrics to guide development decisions
- Prioritize security fixes based on SHS trends
- Plan refactoring based on code quality metrics

### Team Communication
- Share insights with development teams
- Use analytics in sprint planning and retrospectives
- Track improvement initiatives with historical data

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Data
- Verify repository indexing status
- Check GitHub token permissions
- Ensure integrations are properly configured

### Outdated Metrics
- Run manual indexing commands
- Check integration service status
- Verify API rate limits
