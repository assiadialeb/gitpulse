## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in GitPulse, **please do not publicly disclose it** in issues, pull requests, or discussions.

Instead, report it privately via GitHub's security advisory form:

### What to include in your report:

- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- The potential impact of the vulnerability.
- Any suggested fix or workaround, if available.

## Response Process

1. We will acknowledge your report within **3 business days**.
2. We will investigate the issue and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.
3. We will work with you to validate the fix before release.
4. With your permission, we may credit you in the changelog or security advisory.

Thank you for helping keep GitPulse secure!
